(Short: Estimates the CO2 emissions for driving on routes suggested by Google Maps!)

Whenever you ask Google Maps for driving directions, this browser extension automatically estimates the total CO2 emission caused by driving on the suggested routes. The estimation is shown next to the route's total distance.

To improve the accuracy of the estimations, the options allow you to configure several parameters related to the fuel comsumption and environment-friendliness of your car.

If you have comments or questions, please send them to MapsCarbonFootprint@gmail.com.
